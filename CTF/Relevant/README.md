## Description

The room creates a situation where you are assigned to a client to perform a black box penetration test on a provided virtual environment.  As a proof of exploitation, the pentesting must provide two flags found on the system:
- user.txt
- root.txt


## Scope Allowances

* There are no restrictions for tools and techniques that can be used by the pentester, **however** manual exploitation is to be tried first
* Locate and identify all vulnerabilities found
* Retrieve all flags discovered
* The scope of the test is limited to the provided IP address
