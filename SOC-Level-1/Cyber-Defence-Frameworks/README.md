A collection of noted and a summary of what I have learned from TryHackMe's SOC Level 1's Cyber Defence Framework module.

## Junior Security Analyst Intro
---
*What does a Junior Securty Analyst do?*: A Junior Security Analyst is supposed to be a _Triage Specalist_ and a primary part of their job is meant monitoring log data and managing IDS and IPS alerts as well as managing other security tools.

Junior Security Analysts are only meant to configure and implement security solutions and tool configuration and if a security incident occurs, it should be reported and escalated to a highter tier team in the Security Operations Center.

#### **What is a SOC?**
---
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team that handles the prevention, monitoring, investigation, and the response to cyber security threats.  A SOC is a 24 hour operation that is always active.

To elaborate on this circle of responsiblities, the best place to start is with _Log Collection_

**Log Collection** is the collection and maintainence of log files that store all the activity and communications taking place on the networks relevent to the SOC.  Logging these activities allows for tracing back and pinpointing any past actions that have affecting a security incident.  Log collection and analysis is also important for establishing a baseline for normal activity, increasing the effectiveness of IDS and IPS systems.
